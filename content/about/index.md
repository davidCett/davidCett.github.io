## A Brief Bio
#
Welcome 😁. My name is David Cettolo. I grew up in [Trieste, Italy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trieste,+Province+of+Trieste,+Italy/@45.6499624,13.7210459,11.5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x477b6b06e4edf533:0x666a2484d4dd2b50!8m2!3d45.6495264!4d13.7768182!16zL20vMGZqc2w?entry=ttu).\
<br>
I am a **software engineer** primarly specialising in **.NET** development and **cloud-based** solutions. On daily basis, I work with a variety of tecnologies to develop and deploy
lean, efficient, reliable and maintainable software solutions. That includes leveraging the [.NET framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) for application development, utilizing [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) cloud services for cloud-based infrastracture and implementing **CI/CD** pipelines with tools like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to automate the software delivery process.\

Beyond my professional life, I am passionate about sports 🏐, outdoor 🌊 and cooking 🍝.
